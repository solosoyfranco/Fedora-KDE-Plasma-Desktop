# Fedora Workstation 40+ (KDE Plasma) - Post-Install Script
Welcome to my personal Fedora KDE Plasma installation script! This script is tailored for my home workstation and is also installed on my everyday laptop. I'm  currently using the latest stable version of Fedora. My focus areas include software development, networking, entertainment, VR, Gaming, electronics, 3d Modeling/Printing, music creation, server management, and virtual machines. I’ve also included extra tools that could be useful for other tasks beyond my usual needs.

This script is largely inspired by WinUtil by Chris Titus, adapted to fit my workflow in the Linux environment. It’s a blend of ideas from various sources and personal experience. Feel free to customize it for your own setup, and I’m always open to feedback and suggestions!
